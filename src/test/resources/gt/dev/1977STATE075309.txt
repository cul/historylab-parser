1. [[WE ||1]] ARE SENDING ADDRESSEES SEPARATELY A RATHER LONG ANALYTICAL PIECE ON SITUATION IN [[SOUTH LEBANON || 2]] WHICH HAS BEEN IN WORKS FOR SOME TIME AND WHICH [[WE || 1]] HAVE TO KEEP REVISING DAILY AS SITUATION ON GROUND CHANGES. FOLLOWING IS ATTEMPT PUT EVERYTHING INTO FOCUS VERY BRIEFLY.


2. [[[[LEBANESE  || 3]] CHRISTIAN FORCES || 4]], PERHAPS PRODDED BY [[ISRAELIS || 5]], EVIDENTLY DECIDED TO PUSH THROUGH CONSOLIDATION [[THEIR || 4]] SECURITY ZONE ALONG [[SOUTHERN BORDER || 6]] IMMEDIATELY AFTER SACKING OF FORMER  [[ARMY|| 15]] COMMANDER [[HANNA || 10]] SAID. LAST WEEK [[THEY  || 4]] TOOK [[TAIBEH || 7]] AND THREATENED THE CHAIN OF VILLAGES PARALLELING [[ISRAELI BORDER || 8]] JUST WEST OF [[METULLA || 9]]. [[THEIR || 4]] APPARENT INTENT WAS TO GET IT ALL SEWED UP BEFORE NEW [[ARMY|| 15]] COMMANDER WAS ABLE, OR FORCED, TO INTERFERE.


3. [[SYRIANS || 11]] AND [[FATAH || 12]], WHO HAD BEEN QUIESCENT IN AREA, HAVE APPARENTLY REACTED BY HELPING [[LEFTISTS || 13]] RETAKE [[TAIBEH || 7]] (AS OF THIS WRITING [[IT|| 7]] ALLEGEDLY BACK IN [[LCF || 4]] HANDS), [[SYRIANS || 11]] REPORTEDLY SHELLING [[MARJAYUN || 3]] AND GIVING ARTILLERY SUPPORT TO [[PALESTINIANS || 14]] FOR FIRST TIME.


4. THERE IS CONSIDERABLE LOCAL AGITATION ON SUBJECT, AND MANY RUMORS, SUCH AS THAT OF [[AIN JALOUT BRIGADE || 16]] HAVING RETURNED, WHICH ARE CONFUSING PICTURE. ([[[[IRANIAN || 17]] AMBASSADOR || 18]] HAS JUST COME IN TO REPORT [[YARMOUK BRIGADE || 19]] IN [[NABATIYEH || 3]].) QUESTION FOR [[US|| 1]] IS, HAVE [[SYRIANS || 11]] DECIDED THAT [[TAIBEH || 7]] (WHICH CONTROLS WATER DISTRIBUTION IN [[THAT AREA||7]]) IS RED LINE FOR [[LCF || 4]]? OR DO [[THEY || 4]] HAVE SOME NEW ACTION PLAN FOR [[AREA||7]]? BELIEVE ANSWER LIES IN [[DAMASCUS || 20]], NOT [[HERE ||2 ]].
