[[ [[US || 8]] CINC [[ SO || 10]] ||  9]] FOR [[POLAD || 11 ]]


1. FOLLOWING A MEETING WITH [[MNINTERIOR CASTRO || 6]] WHEN THEY PRESENTED THEMSELVES AS VOLUNTARY PRISONERS, FEMALE RELATIVES OF POLITICAL PRISONERS AGREED TO GRANT [[MINIZTERIOR || 6 ]] 24 HOURS IN WHICH TO COMPLY WITH [[HIS || 6]] PROMISE TO ACCELERATE JUDICIAL HANDLING OF POLITICAL PRISONERS. 


AT CONCLUSION MEETING [[MININTERIOR || 6]] ISSUED COMMUNIQUE STATING THAT PRISONERS WERE TREATED HUMANELY, AND THAT IN STRICT COMPLIANCE WITH THE LAW THE CASES OF ALL POLITICAL PRISONERS WERE BEING SUBMITTED TO [[THE JUDICIARY || 4]] AND THAT THOSE WITH MINOR COMPLICITY WOULD BE RELEASED. PRESS REPORTS OF [[CASTRO' S || 6 ]] MEETING WITH THE WOMEN CARRIED AN ADMISSION BY [[CASTRO || 6]] THAT " FOR DISCIPLINARY PURPOSES", SOME PRISONERS WERE MILDLY BEATEN.


2. IN RESPONSE TO THE WOMEN' S LETTER TO [[MININTERIOR || 6 ]], THE [[COMMISSION||1]] FOR PEACE AND JUSTICE MADE ANOTHER PUBLIC APPEAL TO [[PRESIDENT BANZER||1]] FOR A NATIONWIDE AMNESTY AS THE FIRST STEP " FOR THE PACIFICATION AND CONSTITUTIONALIZACION OF [[THE COUNTRY || 2]]." THE [[COMMISSION||1]] ALSO NOTED THAT IT BELIEVES THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY 400 POLITICAL PRISONERS IN [[THE COUNTRY || 3]]. PRESS OF JUNE 14 PUBLISHED THE NAMES OF 74 POLITICAL PRISONERS WHOSE CASES WERE PRESENTED JUNE 13 TO [[VARIOUS JUDGES || 4]] FOR PROCESSING; HOWEVER, NO MENTION WAS MADE OF THE DISPOSITION OF THE REMAINING PRISIONERS' CASES.


3. COMMENT: THE WOMEN' S ACTION HAS OBVIOUSLY GIVEN THE [[GOB || 2]] THE IMPULSE [[IT || 2]] NEEDED TO BEGIN SERIOUS [[JUDICIAL || 4]] CONSIDERATION OF THE POLITICAL PRISONERS' CASES. NEVERTHELESS, [[[[BOLIVIAN || 2 ]] JUDICIARY || 4]] PROCESSES GRIND SLOWLY, AND [[WE || 8]] ANTICIPATE THAT ADDITIONAL PUBLIC MANIFESTATIONS BY THE PRISONERS' RELATIVES WILL OCCURE PRIOR TO FINAL RESOLUTION OF THE CASES.
