1. ON OCCASION OF [[MFA || 1]] RECEPTION BY [[NEW FOREIGN MINISTER || 2]], [[I || 3]] HAD OCCASION TO REGISTER WITH [[SENIOR MFA OFFICIALS || 1]] [[OUR || 16]] STRONG FEELINGS ABOUT CURRENT ATTEMPTS TO UPGRADE [[GRUNK || 5]] AND [[PRG || 9]]. IN SEPARATE TALKS WITH [[DIRECTOR OF POLITICAL AFFAIRS (WACHTMEISTER) || 10]] AND [[[[HIS ||10 ]] DEPUTY (EDELSTAM) || 11]], [[I || 3]]  REFERRED TO ATTEMPT TO ACCREDIT [[GRUNK || 5]] AS REPRESENTATIVE OF [[CAMBODIA || 7]] AT [[UN ||8 ]] AND POSSIBLE EFFORT TO SHOEHORN [[GRUNK || 5]] AND [[PRG || 9]] INTO LOS CONFERENCE.


2. BOTH, OF COURSE, SAID [[GOS || 12]] POSITION WAS TO ABSTAIN ON SUCH ISSUES. [[I || 3]] POINTED OUT THAT, IN THIS CASE, ABSTENTION MIGHT HAVE SAME EFFECT AS VOTING FOR [[PRG || 9]] AND [[GRUNK || 5]] DUE TO CLOSE VOTE AND MANY PROSPECTIVE ABSTENTIONS. [[WACHTMEISTER|| 10]], WHO IS FLYING TO [[NEW YORK || 13]] TOMORROW, WAS INTERESTED IN ARITHMETIC OF THE SITUATION.


3. WITH REFERENCE TO [[KLACKENBERG'S ||14]] EFFORTS TO PROMOTE EQUAL STATUS FOR  [[PRG || 9]] VIS-A-VIS [[GVN ||15]] ON INTERNATIONAL AID POLICY (REF B), [[I || 3]] TOLD [[EDALSTAM || 11]] [[WE ||16]] HAD NOTED THIS PRFORMANCE AND DEPLORED IT. [[GOS  || 12]] SHOULD BE AWARE THAT [[WE || 16]] REGARD [[PRG || 9]] AS HAVING NONE OF THE ATTRIBUTES OF A STATE AND, SINCE [[GOS|| 12]] CONSIDERED AND REJECTED FOR SAME REASONS RECOGNIZING [[PRG ||9]], [[ITS || 12]] PERFORMANCE IN [[PARIS||17]] WAS HARD TO UNDERSTAND. [[EDALSTAM || 11]] MADE NO SUBSTANTIVE REJOINDER, MERELY SAYING [[OUR||16]] VIEW WOULD BE NOTED.


4. COMMENT: IT MIGHT BE WELL FOR [[USUN ||18]] TO FOLLOW UP WITH [[WACHTMEISTER|| 10]] WHEN [[HE ||10]] ARRIVES IF THE GAME IS NOT ALREADY OVER. ONLY SLIM CHANCE TO MOVE [[SWEDEN ||12]] OFF ABSTAIN POSITION ON REPRESEN- TATION ISSUES WOULD SEEM TO BE TO CONVINCE SUCH AS [[WACHTMEISTER|| 10]] THAT WORLD WOULD REGARD THIS AS VOTING FOR LIBERATION GOVERNMENTS.
