1. [[DR. HYDER || 1 ]] LAS CORRECT IN THAT THERE WAS A CONFERENCE ON NON-PROLIFERATION HELD UNDER THE PRIVATE AUSPICES OF [[THE ASPEN INSITUTE FOR HUMANISTIC STUDIES || 2]]. THE CONFERENCE WAS LED BY [[HARLAN CLEVELAND || 3]] AND WAS ATTENDED BY ABOUT 50 U.S. AND FOREIGN LEADERS IN THEIR PERSONAL, NOT OFFICIAL, CAPA- CITIES. AMONG THOSE PRESENT WERE NRC COMMISSIONER [[KENNEDY || 5]] (WHO IS, OF COURSE, NOT A MEMBER OF [[THE ADMINISTRATION || 9]] ) AND [[[[DEPARTMENT || 11]] COUNSELOR SONNENFELDT || 6]]. [[AMBASSADOR IQBAL AKHUND || 7]] ATTENDED AND PARTICIPATED IN NEARLY ALL SESSIONS; [[AMBASSA- DOR YAQUB KHAN || 8]] WAS ALSO PRESENT AT A FEW. TOPICS DISCUSSED DEALT WITH THE IMPERATIVES WHICH DRIVE NATIONS TO ACQUIRE NUCLEAR ARMS; ASSESSMENT OF UNILATERAL AND MULTILATERAL MEASURES WHICH MIGHT BE ADOPTED TO RETARD NUCLEAR PROLIFERA- TION; AND EXPLORATION OF PROSPECTS FOR MANAGING "A PRO- LIFERATED WORLD" IF THOSE MEASURES FAIL.


2. ALTHOUGH  [[DR. HYDER || 1 ]] WAS CORRECT THAT THERE WAS A CON- FERENCE, [[SHE ||1]] WAS NOT CORRECT IN REFERRING TO CONCLUSIONS REACHED. THE OBJECT OF THE CONFERENCE WAS TO PROVIDE A FORUM FOR AN OPEN-ENDED DISCUSSION WITH A WIDE SPECTRUM OF VIEWS; THERE WAS NO EFFORT TO DEVELOP A CONSENSUS AND CONSEQUENTLY NO CONCLUSIONS WERE REACHED.


3.[[ THE INSTITUTE || 2]] HAS JUST FINISHED WRITING UP SUMMARIES OF THE SESSIONS BUT IS RELUCTANT TO DISTRIBUTE THEM LEST INTERESTED PARTIES TRY TO MISLEADINGLY CONTRAST PARTICI- PANTS PERSONAL AND OFFICIAL VIEWS. HOWEVER, IN THIS REGARD, [[WE || 11]] UNDERSTAND THAT [[THE USG PARTICIPANTS || 9]] AT THE CONFERENCE MADE RELATIVELY FEW COMMENTS--AND THOSE WHICH THEY DID MAKE CONFORMED TO [[USG || 9 ]] POLICY.


4. [[WE || 11]] WILL CONTINUE TO SEEK TO OBTAIN THE SUMMARIES OF THE CONFERENCE AND WILL TRANSMIT TO [[YOU || 12]] ANYTHING WORTH- WHILE.


[[KISSINGER || 10]]
