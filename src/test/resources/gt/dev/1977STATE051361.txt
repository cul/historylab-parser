1. THE FOLLOWING IS TEXT OF [[PRESIDENTIAL || 1]] DIRECTIVE/[[NSC-4 || 2]] DATED MARCH 8, 1977: BEGIN TEXT: 


[[I || 3]] HAVE REVIEWED THE [[PRESIDENTIAL || 1]] REVIEW MEMORANDUM/[[NSC-18 || 2]], PART 1, RESPONSE IN- CLUDING SPECIFICALLY THE RECOMMENDATIONS AND [[AGENCY || 2]] VIEWS ON LOS NEGOTIATING AND LEGISLATIVE POSTURES. THE DECISIONS SET FORTH BELOW ARE INTENDED AS INTERIM GUIDANCE FOR THE INTERSESSIONAL SESSIONS ONLY. AN ASSESSMENT OF THE RESULTS OF THESE MEETINGS, AS WELL AS FULL ANALYSIS OF STRATEGIC OPTIONS AND ACCEPTABLE TREATY PACKAGES, ARE TO BE SUBMITTED THROUGH [[THE POLICY REVIEW COMMITTEE || 5]] FOR FULL INTERAGENCY CONSIDERATION AND [[MY || 3]] DECISION PRIOR TO THE NEXT LOS CON- FERENCE (MAY 23-JUNE 8). THE STUDY ON SEABED MINING LEGIS- LATION CONTINUES TO BE DUE TO [[THE POLICY REVIEW COMMITTEE || 5]] BY MARCH 21, 1977.
PENDING  [[MY || 3]] FURTHER REVIEW AND DECISION, EXISTING INSTRUC- TIONS ARE REAFFIRMED AS MODIFIED BELOW:


1. [[I || 3]] APPROVE THE RECOMMENDATION THAT [[THE U.S. || 4]] SHOULD CONTINUE TO SEEK AGREEMENT ON A COMPREHENSIVE TREATY WHICH ACCOMMODATES [[OUR || 4]]  ESSENTIAL INTERNATIONAL, SECURITY, COMMERCIAL NAVIGATION, RESOURCE, ENVIRONMENTAL AND SCIEN- TIFIC INTERESTS.


2. WITH RESPECT TO THE DEEP SEABEDS,  [[THE U.S. || 4]] SHOULD CON- TINUE TO SEEK AN INTERNATIONAL REGIME FOR THE DEEP SEABEDS WHICH WILL FACILITATE RATIONAL INVESTMENT IN DEEP SEABED MINING AND PRODUCTION AND WHICH WILL INCLUDE A SYSTEM WHICH PROVIDES ASSURED [[U.S. || 4]] ACCESS ON A NON-DISCRIMINATORY BASIS TO THESE MINERALS. IN FURTHERING THIS OBJECTIVE AND WHILE CONTINUING TO SUPPORT  [[THE U.S. || 4]] PROPOSALS FOR A PARALLEL SYSTEM OF MINING WHICH INCLUDES BOTH STATES AND THEIR NATIONALS AS WELL AS AN INTERNATIONAL ENTERPRISE, [[MY ||3]] SPECIAL REPRESENTATIVE MAY INFORMALLY CONSIDER OTHER MECHANISMS WHICH PROTECT [[OUR ||4]]  INTERESTS, AND PERMIT QUALIFIED STATES AND PRIVATE PARTIES TO OBTAIN ASSURED ACCESS ON A NON-DISCRIMINATORY BASIS TO SEABED RESOURCES.


3. [[I ||3]] APPROVE THE RECOMMENDATION THAT [[THE DELEGATION ||5]] BE GRANTED THE FLEXIBILITY TO EXPLORE VARIOUS KINDS OF INTERIM REGIMES WHICH WOULD FULLY PROTECT [[U.S. || 4]] RESOURCE INTERESTS.


4. WITH RESPECT TO DEEP SEABED MINING LEGISLATION, [[I ||3]] DIRECT THAT [[THE ADMINISTRATION || 4]] WILL: WORK WITH [[CONGRESS || 6]] IN A MANNER WHICH WOULD OPTIMALLY CONTRIBUTE TO ACCELERATING PROGRESS ON SEABEDS AT THE NEXT CONFERENCE SESSION; NOT SUPPORT ENACTMENT OF DEEP SEABED LEGISLATION PRIOR TO THE END OF THE NEXT SESSION; INDICATE THAT IT PREFERS NON-SITE SPECIFIC LEGISLATION. ALL THESE DECISIONS MAY BE MODIFIED DUE TO THE RESULTS OF THE INTERSESSIONAL MEETINGS, OR THE FINDINGS OF PART 3 OF THE LOS PRM/[[NSC-18 || 2]] REVIEW. FINAL DECISIONS ON DETAILED SUBSTANCE AND APPROPRIATE TIMING OF POSSIBLE LEGISLATION ARE RESERVED UNTIL THAT STUDY IS COM- PLETED. END TEXT.
