[[LOCAL LEADER OF [[ISKCON (INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY FOR KRISHNA CONSCIOUSNESS) ||1]], [[AMERICAN || 2]] CITIZEN GREGORY SCHARF || 3]], CAME TO [[CONSULATE || 5]] SEP 7 TO COMPLAIN ABOUT WHAT [[HE || 3]] CONSIDERED [[GOI || 4]]  HARASSMENT OF [[[[AMERICAN || 2]] MEMBERS OF [[SOCIETY ||1]] || 15]]. ACCORDING TO [[SCHARF|| 3]], [[HIS|| 3]] OFFICE IN [[CALCUTTA ||6]]  WAS CALLED BY [[FOREIGN REGISTRATION OFFICE || 7]] TO INQUIRE ABOUT CONNECTION BETWEEN [[[[CONGEN || 8]] OFFICERS O'NEILL AND LIEBOWITZ || 9]] AND [[ISKCON || 1]]. (AS [[WE || 5]] HAVE PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, [[O'NEILL || 13]] HAS SEEN [[[[ISKCON ||1]] MEMBERS || 15]] ONLY WHEN [[THEY || 15]] CALLED AT [[CONGEN || 8]] IN CONNECTION WITH [[CONSULAR || 8]] MATTERS, AND [[LIEBOWITZ || 14]] VISITED [[SOCIETY'S ||1]] [[MAYAPUR || 6]] CENTER ONLY AT IN- VITATION OF LOCAL DISTRICT OFFICIALS DURING TRIP TO THAT AREA THAT HAD NO CONNECTION WITH [[ISKCON || 1]]).


2. [[SCHARF ||3]] REPORTED THAT TEN [[AMERICANS || 2]] WITH [[THE SOCIETY || 1]], INCLUDING SOME WHO HAD PROPER ENTRY VISAS, HAD RECENTLY RECEIVED LETTERS FROM [[GOI || 4]]  ASKING THEM TO LEAVE [[THE COUNTRY ||6]]. [[HE ||3]] SAID POLICE HAD COME TO QUESTION [[HIM ||3]] IN [[CALCUTTA ||6]], AND TOLD [[HIM ||3]] THEY KNEW [[HE ||3]] WAS A [[CIA || 10]] AGENT. [[HE ||3]] ALSO SAID THAT SPECIAL AGENTS FROM [[DELHI || 6]] HAD BEEN CARRYING ON INVESTIGATIONS AROUND [[MAYAPUR || 6]] CENTER. ACCORDING TO  [[SCHARF ||3]], OTHER FOREIGN NATIONALS ASSOCIATED WITH [[ISKCON || 1]] HAVE NOT BEEN HARASSED LIKE [[THE AMERICANS || 15]].
