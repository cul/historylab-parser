BEGIN SUMMARY: [[GERMANS||1]] HAVE SO FAR MUTED PUBLIC REACTION BUT [[THE [[FRG||1]] [[DISARMAMENT||16]] COMMISSIONER||2]] HAS EXPRESSED "GENUINE SHOCK" OVER [[INDIA'S||3]] DECISION TO GO NUCLEAR. [[GERMANS||1]] ARE GREATLY TROUBLED THAT THIS FIRST BREACH IN NONPROLIFERATION POLICY SINCE NPT CAN LEAD AGAIN TO NTH COUNTRY PROBLEM, PARTICULARLY IN [[MIDEAST||4]] AND/OR [[SOUTH AFRICA||5]]. [[BONN||1]] ALSO WORRIED THAT [[JAPAN||6]] AND [[ITALY||7]] MIGHT NOW DELAY RATIFICATION; GIVEN INTERPLAY BETWEEN NPT AND VERIFICATION AGREEMENT, [[GERMANS||1]] UNLIKELY TO DEPOSIT NPT RATIFICATION INSTRUMENTS UNTIL [[ITALY||7]] RATIFIES BOTH TREATIES. [[[[FRG||1]] SPOKESMAN||8]] HAS BEEN AUTHORIZED TO INFORM PRESS, ON IF ASKED BASIS, THAT [[GERMANY||1]] "REGRETS" [[INDIAN||3]] TEST. [[GERMANS||1]] MAY WISH TO CONSULT WITH [[US||9]] (AND [[UK||10]]), PERHAPS DURING [[DEPUTY SECRETARY RUSH'S||11]] VISIT, ON WHAT TO DO NEXT REGARDING [[INDIA||3]] (PERHAPS WITHHOLDING NUCLEAR MATERIALS) AND NON-PROLIFERATION. END SUMMARY.

1. OFFICIAL [[FRG||1]] REACTION TO THE [[INDIAN||3]] NUCLEAR EXPLOSION HAS BEEN MUTED SO FAR. THE PRESS HAS CARRIED NUMEROUS REPORTS AND EDITORIALS RANGING FROM SKEPTICISM OVER [[NEW DELHI'S||3]] PROFESSED PEACEFUL INTENTIONS TO CONDEMNATION OF THE FIRST BREACH IN NON-PROLIFERATION POLICY SINCE THE NEGOTIATION AND SIGNING OF THE NPT. THE PRESS HAS SPOKEN MUCH OF [[INDIAN||3]] "HYPOCRISY" AND/OR [[INDIRA GHANDI’S||12]] USE OF THE NUCLEAR EXPLOSION TO DIVERT ATTENTION OF [[INDIA'S||3]] MASSES FROM THE MORE MUNDANE BUT PRESSING EXIGENCIES OF DAILY WANTS. AFTER BEING INFORMED PERSONALLY MAY 18 BY [[THE [[INDIAN||3]] [[FOREIGN||17]] MINISTER||13]] OF THE NUCLEAR TEST AND ITS "PEACEFUL PURPOSES", [[[[FRG||3]] AMBASSADOR (IN [[DELHI||14]]) DIEHL||15]] CABLED BACK AN ANALYSIS STRESSING [[MRS. GHANDI’S||12]] WISH TO USE THE TEST FOR DOMESTIC POLITICAL PURPOSES. NEITHER [[DIEHL||15]] NOR [[BONN||1]] ATTACH MUCH CREDIBILITY TO TALK OF PEACEFUL PURPOSES.

2. AT MAY 22 SOCIAL EVENT, [[[[FRG||1]] [[DISARMAMENT||16]] COMMISSIONER ROTH||2]] TOOK [[EMBOFF||18]] ASIDE TO EXPLAIN AT SOME LENGTH [[HIS||2]] GENUINE SHOCK OVER IMPLICATIONS OF [[INDIAN||3]] DECISION TO GO NUCLEAR. IT WAS NOT WHOLLY CLEAR TO [[ROTH||2]] WHY [[DELHI||3]] TOOK THE DECISION AT THIS TIME, SINCE, AS [[ROTH||2]] UNDERSTOOD IT, [[INDIA||3]] HAD HAD THE CAPABILITY TO GO NUCLEAR SINCE 1966. [[THE GERMANS||1]] ARE TRYING TO LEARN MORE REGARDING THE CHARACTERISTICS AND MAGNITUDE OF THE BLAST, AS WELL AS WHICH THIRD COUNTRY NOTED AND MEASURED THE SEISMIC EVENT.

3. BUT, IN [[ROTH'S||2]] WORDS, THE HEART OF THE MATTER IS THAT, FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE THE SIGNING OF THE NPT, THE LID IS OFF THE BOTTLE CONTAINING THE NUCLEAR GENIE AND THE NTH COUNTRY DANGER HAS THUS BEEN RESURRECTED. [[[[FRG||1]] AMB GREWE||19]] HAS CABLED FROM [[TOKYO||20]] [[HIS||19]] ASSESSMENT THAT [[JAPAN||6]] MAY DELAY RATIFICATION OF THE NPT. WHILE LESS PESSIMISTIC THAN [[GREWE||19]] REGARDING [[THE JAPANESE||6]], [[ROTH||2]] DID VOICE CONCERN REGARDING [[SOUTH AFRICA||5]], IN VIEW OF THE METAMORPHASIS OF THE POLITICAL SITUATION IN THE FM

4. NOTING [[AMB MARTIN'S||67]] STATEMENT TO [[THE CCD||68]] ([[GENEVA||51]] 3189), [[ROTH||2]] RECALLED THAT NON-PROLIFERATION HAD BEEN THE CORE OF [[US||9]] NUCLEAR POLICY FOR MORE THAN A DECADE. FROM [[MARTIN'S||67]] BRIEF STATEMENT, [[HE||2]] ASSUMED AND HOPED THAT THIS REMAINED THE CASE.

5. [[ROTH||2]] SAID [[HE||2]] HAD DECIDED INITIALLY TO REACT COOLY TO THE [[INDIAN||3]] TEST AS NOTHING COULD BE GAINED BY INTEMPERATE STATEMENTS OF INDIVIDUAL NATIONS. SO FAR, THERE HAS BEEN NO [[FRG||1]] PUBLIC STATEMENT OF CRITICISM OR DEMARCHE IN [[DELHI||14]]. ON AN IF-ASKED BASIS, [[ROTH||2]] DID AUTHORIZE [[THE [[FRG||1]] SPOKESMAN||8]] TO TELL THE PRESS THAT:
A. [[THE FRG||1]] HAS NOTED "WITH REGRET" THE [[INDIAN||3]] NUCLEAR EXPLOSION;
B. [[THE FRG||1]] CONTINUES TO FAVOR A POLICY OF NON-PROLIFERATION AND WILL GO FORWARD WITH THE DEPOSIT OF THE INSTRUMENTS OF RATIFICATION OF THE NPT IN CONNECTION WITH THE RATIFICATION OF THE NPT AND [[EURATOM||69]]-[[IAEA||70]] VERIFICATION AGREEMENT BY [[BONN'S||1]] OTHER [[EC||71]] PARTNERS -- I.E. INCLUDING [[ITALY||7]].
C. [[THE FRG||1]] HAS NOTED -- WITHOUT FURTHER COMMENT -- THE STATEMENT OF [[THE [[INDIAN||3]] [[FOREIGN||17]] MINISTER||13]] REGARDING [[INDIA'S||3]] "PEACEFUL PURPOSES". AS FAR AS [[WE||21]] HAVE SEEN, THE [[GERMAN||59]] PRESS HAS NOT YET REPORTED THIS STATEMENT OF OFFICIAL [[FRG||1]] REACTION.

6. [[ROTH||2]] EMPHASIZED THE VIEW, WHICH [[HE||2]] WILL PUT MAY 24 TO [[[[FONOFF||72]] STATE SECRETARY FRANK||73]], THAT [[THE MAJOR [[WESTERN||74]] SIGNATORIES OF THE NPT||75]] ([[US||9]], [[UK||10]], [[FRG||1]]) SHOULD COORDINATE AN EFFECTIVE REACTION TO THE [[INDIAN||3]] TEST IF THE CREDIBILITY OF THE NON-PROLIFERATION POLICY IS TO BE MAINTAINED. IN PARTICULAR, [[ROTH||2]] INTENDS TO RECOMMEND TO [[FRANK||73]] THAT [[THE GERMANS||1]] USE THE VISIT TO [[BONN||59]] OF [[DEPUTY SECRETARY RUSH||11]] TO DISCUSS THE POSSIBLE COORDINATION OF PUBLIC STATEMENTS AND/OR DEMARCHES IN [[NEW DELHI||14]]. AS TO CONCRETE ACTION, [[ROTH||2]] OPPOSES EXPLOITATION OF [[DELHI'S||3]] DEPENDENCE ON [[WESTERN||74]] ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE -- [[INDIA||3]] GETS DM 350 MILLION ANNUALLY FROM [[BONN||1]]. [[HE||2]] IS INCLINED, HOWEVER, TO EXAMINE A THREATENED CUT-OFF IN THE SUPPLY OF FISSILE MATERIALS. [[ROTH||2]] WILL ENCOURAGE [[FRANK||73]] TO COORDINATE [[WESTERN||74]] POLICIES WITH [[THE US||9]], [[UK||10]] AND OTHER APPROPRIATE COUNTRIES. [[HE||2]] ASSUMES [[FRANCE||76]] WILL NOT WISH TO JOIN IN SUCH COORDINATION.

7. [[ROTH||2]] CONCLUDED BY EXPRESSING [[HIS||2]] CONCERN THAT THE [[INDIAN||3]] TEST MIGHT RESULT IN A FURTHER DELAY IN [[ITALIAN||7]] RATIFICATION OF THE NPT AND [[EURATOM||69]]-[[IAEA||70]] VERIFICATION AGREEMENT. [[HE||2]] RECALLED THAT NPT ARTICLE 3 HAS AN EIGHTEEN-MONTH TIME LIMIT FOR THE ENTERING INTO FORCE OF THE VERIFICATION AGREEMENT (SEE [[BONN||59]] 4114). [[HE||2]] NOTED THE ALREADY "GLACIAL PACE" OF [[ITALIAN||7]] RATIFICATION PROCEEDINGS AND SAID THAT [[BONN||1]] HAD NO WISH TO DEPOSIT [[ITS||1]] NPT RATIFICATION INSTRUMENTS, ONLY LATER TO BE PLACED IN VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 3 DUE TO [[ITALIAN||7]] PROCRASTINATION. ACCORDINGLY, SAID [[ROTH||2]], WHILE [[THE FRG||1]] INTENDS TO GO FORWARD WITH THE NPT RATIFICATION PROCESS, [[BONN||1]] IS UNLIKELY TO DEPOSIT [[ITS||1]] INSTRUMENTS OF RATIFICATION UNTIL [[THE [[ITALIAN||7]] PARLIAMENT||77]] RATIFIES BOTH THE NPT AND THE VERIFICATION AGREEMENT.

8. [[ROTH||2]] TOLD [[EMBOFF||18]] THAT [[[[CDU||78]] DEPUTY KURT BIRRENBACH||79]] HAD INFORMED [[HIM||2]] OF [[HIS||79]] DEEP CONCERN BOTH WITH THE [[INDIAN||3]] NUCLEAR TEST AND WITH POSSIBLE IMPLICATIONS FOR [[ITALIAN||7]] RATIFICATION TIMETABLE. [[BIRRENBACH||79]], WHO WAS VERY HELPFUL IN ROUNDING UP MAJORITY [[[[CDU||78]]/[[CSU||80]]||81]] SUPPORT FOR [[[[FRG||1]] PARLIAMENTARY||82]] RATIFICATION OF THE NPT, ALSO MADE THE SAME POINTS MAY 22 TO [[THE AMBASSADOR||83]].
