REF [[TAIPEI ||1]] 5262


FOLLOWING IS FULL TEXT OF [[MOFA ||2]] STATEMENT RELEASED AUGUST 27 AND CARRIED BY ALL LOCAL NEWSPAPERS IN FRONT PAGE COVERAGE ALONGSIDE STORIES OF [[HOLBROOKE || 3]]-[[CHIANG ||4]] MEETING. BEGIN TEXT.
-----------


[[THE PEIPING REGIME || 5]] NOW OCCUPYING [[THE CHINESE MAINLAND || 17]] IS A REBEL GROUP, HAVING ABSOLUTELY NO RIGHT TO REPRESENT [[THE [[CHINESE || 6]] PEOPLE || 7]]. ANY AGREEMENT OR UNDERSTANDING INVOLVING THE RIGHTS AND INTERESTS OF [[THE REPUBLIC OF CHINA || 6]] AND [[[[ITS || 6]] PEOPLE ||7]], WHICH MIGHT HAVE BEEN REACHED BETWEEN [[THE UNITED STATES || 8]] AND [[THE CHINESE [[COMMUNIST|| 9]] REGIME || 5]] AS A RESULT OF [[ MR. VANCE'S || 10 ]] VISIT, SHALL BE CONSIDERED NULL AND VOID BY [[THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF CHINA || 21]].


ANY STEP [[THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT || 8]] MAY TAKE TO MOVE CLOSER TO  [[THE CHINESE [[COMMUNIST|| 9]] REGIME || 5]] WOULD UNDOUBTEDLY CREATE A NEW RISK OF WAR IN [[ASIA || 11]] AND OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD, WHICH UNQUESTIONABLY RUNS COUNTER TO THE GOAL OF [[THE UNITED STATES|| 8]] IN [[ITS|| 8]] PURSUIT OF WORLD PEACE. DURING THE PAST TWO DECADES, [[THE GOVERNMENT ||  5]] AND [[PEOPLE OF [[THE REPUBLIC OF CHINA || 21]] || 22]] HAVE SPARED NO EFFORT TO DEVELOP DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS AND A FREE ECONOMY WITH A VIEW TO DEVELOP DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS AND A FREE ECONOMY WITH A VIEW TO ENABLING THE MORE THAN 16 MILLION [[CHINESE RESIDING IN [[TAIWAN || 1]], [[PENGHU || 13]], [[KINMEN ||14]] AND [[MATSU ||15]] || 12]] TO ENJOY A PEACEFUL AND PROSPEROUS LIFE. [[THE REPUBLIC OF CHINA || 21]] HAS BECOME NOT ONLY THE BEACON OF HOPE FOR THE 800 MILLION [[CHINESE ON [[THE MAINLAND ||17]] || 16]] AND THE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF [[OVERSEAS CHINESE ||18]], BUT ALSO AN IMPORTANT BULWARK IN THE MAINTENANCE OF PEACE AND STABILITY IN [[NORTHEAST ASIA || 19]] AND [[THE WESTERN PACIFIC ||20 ]]. IT IS HOPED THAT IN [[ITS || 8]] DEALINGS WITH [[THE CHINESE COMMUNIST REGIME ||5]], [[THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES || 8]] WOULD GIVE MOST CAREFUL CONSIDERATION TO [[ITS || 8]] OWN LONG-RANGE INTERESTS AND THE REPERCUSSIONS THESE DEALINGS MAY HAVE ON WORLD PEACE IN GENERAL AND ON PEACE IN [[ASIA||11]] IN PARTICULAR, SO AS TO AVOID IRREPARABLE MISTAKES.


[[THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF CHINA || 21]] WILL CONTINUE TO STAND FIRM IN CARRYING OUT [[ ITS || 21]] ANTI-[[COMMUNIST || 9]] NATIONAL POLICY FOR THE FULFILLMENT OF [[ITS || 21]] SACRED MISSION OF RESTORING FREEDOM TO THE 800 MILLION [[CHINESE LIVING ON [[THE CHINESE MAINLAND || 17]] || 16]].
