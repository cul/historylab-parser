[[KOLWEZI ||1]], AND [[ANGOLAN || 15]]-[[NIGERIAN || 16]] RELATIONS


1. [[[[NETHERLANDS ||4]] AMBASSADOR ZEYLSTRA || 5]] , JUST RETURNED FROM AN EIGHT-DAY VISIT IN [[LUANDA ||2]], TOLD [[CHARGE ||6]] JUNE 1 THAT "THE BYPT INFORMED SOURCES" IN [[LUANDA ||2]] SAY THAT THE RECENT [[SOUTH AFRICAN || 7]] STRIKE IN [[ANGOLA ||2]] HAD BEEN WAY OFF TARGET AND HAD THEREFORE RESULTED IN THE DEATH OF MANY NON-COMBATANTS. HOWEVER, ON THE RETURN FROM THAT STRIKE THE [[[[SOUTH AFRICAN || 7]]  FORCES || 8]] BY SHEER LUCK HAD BLUNDERED INTO A MAJOR [[SWAPO || 9]] BASE. IN CONSEQUENCE [[THE SOUTH AFRICANS || 8]] HAD PUT OUT OF ACTION ABOUT 50 PERCENT OF THE EFFECTIVE [[SWAPO FORCES || 9]].


2. [[AMBASSADOR ZEYLSTRA  || 5]] SAID THAT THE PREVAILING VIEW IN [[LUANDA ||2]] IS THAT THE RECENT ATTACK ON [[KOLWEZI ||1]] WAS INSTIGATED BY [[THE EAST GERMANS || 10]] AND [[THE CUBANS || 11]]. THE INTENTION WAS SIMPLY TO KILL ENOUGH FOREIGNERS SO THAT ALL THE OTHERS WOULD BE FRIGHTENED AWAY, WITH GRAVE CONSEQUENCES FOR THE ECONOMY OF [[ZAIRE ||1]].


3.  [[AMBASSADOR ZEYLSTRA  || 5]] ON [[HIS || 5]] FLIGHT BACK TO [[LAGOS || 3]] HAD SAT NEXT TO A [[MR. FOLABEN || 12]], [[CHIEF REPRESENTATIVE OF [[NIGERIAN AIRWAYS || 13]] IN [[LUANDA ||2]]  || 12]]. [[FOLABEN|| 12]] SAID THAT RELATIONS BETWEEN [[ANGOLA ||15]] NAD [[NIGERIAN || 16]] HAD BEEN COOL FOR A LONG TIME BUT THAT THEY HAD FALLEN TO A CONSIDERABLY LOWER LEVEL BEGINNING WITH [[PRESIDENT CARTER'S || 14]] VISIT TO [[LAGOS ||3]] BECAUSE OF THE SUPPORT WHICH [[NIGERIA|| 16]] HAD GIVEN THE [[ANGLO || 18]]-[[AMERICAN || 19]] PLAN ON [[RHODESIA ||17]]. [[THE CHARGE ||6]] TOLD [[THE AMBASSADOR ||5 ]] [[HE ||6]] FOUND THIS STATEMENT SURPRISING BECAUSE [[FMG ||22 ]] SUPPORT FOR THE [[ANGLO || 18]]-[[AMERICAN || 19]] PLAN HAD BEEN CLEARLY VISIBLE FOR SOME TIME BEFORE THAT. [[THE AMBASSADOR || 5]] REPLIED THAT [[ANGOLA ||15]] SELDOM CAME TO DECISIONS OF [[ITS ||15]] OWN THESE DAYS AND THAT THE REAL REASONS OF THE ACUTAL DECISION-MAKERS MIGHT THEREFORE BE DIRRERENT ONES.


4. [[FOLABEN ||12]] HAD ALSO TOLD [[THE AMBASSADOR || 5]] THAT [[[[NIGERIAN || 3]] AIRWAYS || 13]]  HAD RECENTLY BEEN INFORMED THAT [[IT|| 13]] COULD ONLY HAVE CONDITIONAL APPROVAL TO EXTEND [[ITS||13]] PRESENT NON-LUCRATIVE RIGHTS TO FLY BETWEEN [[LAGOS ||3]] AND [[LUANDA ||2]] ON TO [[LUSAKA || 20]] (A PROMISING ADD-ON) BECAUSE [[[[ANGOLA ||2]] AIRLINES || 21]] MIGHT ALSO WISH TO FLY THAT STRETCH. IN COMPLETE FRUSTRATION [[[[NIGERIA  || 3]] AIRWAYS || 13]] HAD THEN PULLED UP STAKES AND TERMINATED [[ITS ||13]] SERVICE BETWEEN [[LAGOS ||3]] AND [[LUANDA ||2]].
