1. SUMMARY. [[ OECD COUNCIL || 3]] HAD PRELIMINARY DISCUSSION ON LANGUAGE QUESTION OF SUPPORT AGREEMENT. [[DUTCH || 4]], SUPPORTED BY SOME OTHERS, MADE COMPROMISE PROPOSAL. DRAFT [[COUNCIL ||3]] DECISION NOT DISCUSSED. END SUMMARY








2. [[ OECD COUNCIL || 3]] ON MARCH 21 TOOK UP ISSUES RELATED TO LANGUAGES IN SUPPORT FUND AGREEMENT. [[DUTCH PERMREP || 14]] MADE COMPROMISE PROPOSAL CONSISTING OF THE FOLLOWING ELEMENTS:








A) THE QUESTION OF OFFICIAL LANGUAGES WHICH APPEARS IN ARTICLE XVI, SECTION 12, OF DRAFT SUPPORT FUND AGREEMENT WOULD BE DELETED. THE EFFECT OF THIS WOULD BE TO LEAVE OFFICIAL LANGUAGE QUESTION TO THE DISCRETION OF [[THE GOVERNING COMMITTEE OF THE FUND ||5]].
B) IN ACCORDANCE WITH PROCEDURE ADOPTED IN IEA, AUTHENTIC TEXT UNDER ARTICLE XXIII, SECTION 5 OF DRAFT SUPPORT FUND AGREEMENT WOULD BE PREPARED IN THREE LANGUAGES, [[ENGLISH || 6]], [[FRENCH || 2]] AND [[GERMAN || 7]].








3. [[DUTCH || 4]] APPEALED TO [[GERMANS || 8]] AND [[ITALIANS || 9]] TO ACCEPT COMPROMISE IN SPIRIT OF AVOIDING COMPLICATIONS AND GETTING ON WITH IMPORTANT TASK OF HAVING EVERYTHING READY FOR SIGNATURE ON APRIL 9. [[DUTCH PERMREP || 14]] RESERVED RIGHT TO ASK FOR USE OF [[DUTCH || 10]] LANGUAGE IF [[ITALIANS || 9]] INSISTED ON HAVING [[THEIRS || 9]]. [[NETHERLANDS || 4]] COMPROMISE SUPPORTED BY [[BELGIANS || 11]], AND ON PERSONAL BASIS BY [[SPANISH PERMREP || 13]].








4. [[GERMAN PERMREP ||15]] INDICATING [[HE ||15]] HAD NOT BEEN AWARE OF [[DUTCH ||4]] COMPROMISE, MADE STATEMENT OF ARGUMENTS IN FAVOR OF USING [[GERMAN ||7]] BOTH AS OFFICIAL LANGUAGE AND IN AUTHENTIC TEXT OF AGREEMENT. [[HE || 15]]  NOTED HIGH QUOTA OF [[GERMANY || 8]] IN FUND, HIGH DEGREE OF POSSIBILITY OF JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS IN CONNECTION WITH BORROWING BY FUND IN

[[GERMAN ||7]] CAPITAL MARKET, FACILITATION OF COMMUNICATION AMONG VARIOUS OFFICIAL ENTITIES IN [[GERMANY||7]] THAT WOULD HAVE TO GET INVOLVED, AND THAT [[PARLIAMENTARY || 21]] APPROVAL OF FUND IN [[GERMANY||7]] WOULD BE EVEN MORE DIFFICULT IF [[GERMAN || 7]] DID NOT APPEAR AS OFFICIAL LANGUAGE AND IN CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH [[GERMAN ||8]] BUDGETARY FUNDS WOULD HAVE TO BE USED TO PAY FOR [[GERMAN || 7]] LANGUAGE SERVICES.








5. [[ITALIAN REP || 16]] ARGUED [[HIS || 16]] OFFICIAL POSITION WAS SIMILAR TO THAT OF [[GERMANY ||8]]. NEVERTHELESS, [[HE || 16]] WOULD BE WILLING TO RECOMMEND TO [[[[HIS || 16]] GOVERNMENT || 9]] THAT SOMETHING ALONG LINES [[NETHERLANDS' || 4]] PROPOSAL BE ACCEPTED IN SPIRIT OF COMPROMISE. WITH RESPECT TO OFFICIAL LANGUAGE, [[HE || 16]] COULD PERSONALLY CONTEMPLATE GOING ALONG WITH DELETION OF SECTION 12 OF ARTICLE XVI. (COMMENT. HOWEVER, [[ITALIAN ||9]] INTERPRETATION OF EFFECT OF THIS DELETION APPEARED TO BE THAT NORMAL [[OECD ||1]] RULES WOULD APPLY.) WITH RESPECT TO AUTHENTIC TEXT, [[ITALIANS ||9]]  SUGGESTED AN ALTERNATIVE TO [[DUTCH || 4]] COMPROMISE TO THE EFFECT THAT ONLY [[ENGLISH || 6]] AND [[FRENCH || 2]] TEXTS WOULD BE SIGNED ON APRIL 9. SUBSEQUENTLY, [[ITALIANS ||9]]  WOULD WISH TO HAVE [[ITALIAN || 17]]  AUTHENTIC TEXT DRAWN UP IN CASE OTHERS (I.E., [[GERMANY || 8]]) INSISTED ON HAVING ONE.








6. [[SECGEN VAN LENNEP || 18]] STATED [[HE  || 18]] FELT DISCUSSION HAD GONE ABOUT AS FAR AS IT COULD BE DEVELOPED UP TO THIS POINT AND SUGGESTED THAT [[COUNCIL ||3]] RETURN TO LANGUAGE QUESTION ON MARCH 25.








7. THE DRAFT  [[COUNCIL ||3]] DECISION TEXT WAS NOT DISCUSSED BY  [[COUNCIL ||3]] ON MARCH 21.  [[COUNCIL ||3]] MAY TURN TO THIS QUESTION ON MARCH 25.








8. [[WE || 19]] UNDERSTAND FROM [[SECRETARIAT || 18]] THAT  [[COUNCIL ||3]] MEETING TO ADOPT DECISION ON SUPPORT FUND WILL BE SCHEDULED FOR APRIL 7.
