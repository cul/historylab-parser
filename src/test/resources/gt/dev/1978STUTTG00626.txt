D) [[ STUTTGART'S ||  1]] OM OF 11/19/76


1. IN ADDITION TO THOSE TOPICS ALREADY SUGGESTED IN REF B, [[ STUTTGART ||  2]] WISHES TO PROPOSE ONE ADDITIONAL TOPIC FOR DISCUSSION AT THE [[PARIS||3]] CONSULAR CONFERENCE.


2. TO QUOTE FROM REF D: "DURING THE REGULAR MILITARY COURIER TRAINING CONFERENCES HELD BY [[THIS CONSULATE  GENERAL|| 6]] ONE QUESTION IS INVARIABLY ASKED AGAIN AND AGAIN: "WHY CAN NATIVE-BORN, REGULAR COMMISSIONED OFFICERS OBTAIN A FULL-VALIDITY PASSPORT ON THE BASIS OF THEIR I.D. CARD ALONE WHILE ENLISTED MEN AND WARRANT OFFICERS MUST ALWAYS PRESENT DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE OF BIRTH?" THIS QUESTION IS USUALLY FOLLOWED WITH THE SUGGESTION THAT AN OFFICIAL EXTRACT OF [[[[DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE||4]] PERSONNEL || 8 ]] RECORDS CERTIFYING AS TO A PERSON'S DATE AND PLACE OF BIRTH SHOULD SUFFICE TO ISSUE A FULL VALIDITY PASSPORT TO NATIVE-BORN ENLISTED PERSONNEL AND WARRANT OFFICERS. THE CONSULAR OFFICER IS LEFT TO QUOTE THE PERTINENT REGULATIONS, THE ENLISTED MEN TO GRUMBLE AND THE REGULAR OFFICERS PRESENT USUALLY TO REMAIN SILENT."


3. BEYOND THE PUBLIC RELATIONS PROBLEMS INHERENT IN THIS SITUATION IS THE WASTE OF TIME AND EFFORT NEEDED TO EXPLAIN TO ENLISTED MEN THE APPLICABLE REGULATIONS, WHERE AND HOW TO WRITE FOR THEIR BIRTH CERTIFICATES AND THE FINAL EXTENSION PROCEDURES FOR THEIR EMERGENCY PASSPORTS ONCE THEY HAVE OBTAINED THEIR BIRTH CERTIFICATES.


4. WHILE [[THE DEPARTMENT'S || 7] ]RESPONSE (REF C) TO [[ OUR || 6]] OM WAS THOROUGH IN REITERATING OUTSTANDING REGULATIONS, IT DID NOT ANSWER [[ OUR || 6]]  BASIC QUESTION AS TO WHETHER ANY CONSIDERATION HAS EVER BEEN GIVEN TO LIBERALIZING THE BIRTH CERTIFICATE REQUIREMENT FOR ENLISTED MEN.
