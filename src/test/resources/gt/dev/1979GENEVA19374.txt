2. REFTELS HAVE CAUGHT [[UNHCR [[GENEVA|| 2]] || 1]] UNPREPARED. [[ODP UNIT || 19]] WAS NOT AWARE OF [[UNHCR/[[HANOI || 4]] || 3]] MESSAGE OF NOVEMBER 27 AND HAD NOT PREVIOUSLY BEEN INFORMED OF PREPARATIONS FOR FLIGHTS ON DECEMBER 20 AND 27. WITH [[DE HAAN ||  5]] DEPARTING FRIDAY FOR [[AFRICA || 6]] AND [[CLARANCE || 7]] SATURDAY FOR [[BANGKOK || 8]], [[UNHCR || 10]] HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO WORK OUT AN OFFICIAL RESPONSE TO [[HANOI || 3]]. [[CLARANCE || 7]] TOLD [[MISSION || 11]] THAT [[UNHCR || 10]] WAS EMBARRASSED BY THE SITUATION, BUT [[GENEVA ||1]] WAS STILL VERY MUCH IN THE DARK CONCERNING WHAT WAS BEING PROPOSED AND FROM WHOM THE PROPOSAL CAME. NEXT STEP WILL BE FOR [[CLARANCE || 7]] TO CLARIFY THE SITUATION AFTER ARRIVAL IN [[BANGKOK||8]]. ([[HE|| 7]] IS SCHEDULED TO MEET WITH [[VU HOANG ||9]] DECEMBER 8).


3. AS A PRELIMINARY REACTION, [[UNHCR [[GENEVA|| 2]] || 1]] SHARES [[BANG- KOK'S ||12]] SUSPICIONS (PARA 8, REFTEL), CONCERNING TIMING AND INTENTIONS UNDERLYING [[SRV || 13]] PROPOSAL. SCHEDULING FLIGHTS FOR DECEMBER 20 AND 27 IS CLEARLY SEEN AS EXCLUDING [[MYERS|| 14]].


4. [[CLARANCE || 7]] ALSO ARGUED AGAINST RESPONDING TO [[VIETNAMESE || 4]] LIST OF 20,000 UNTIL [[U.S.G. ||15]] CAN ACCEPT A MUCH GREATER NUMBER THAN 14 NAMES. IN THIS REGARD [[UNHCR || 10]] IS CLEARLY HOPING FOR POSITIVE RESULTS FROM THE DEEPER SEARCH PRO- CEDURE (1975 CASES, EMPLOYEE LISTS FROM [[U.S.|| 16]] FIRMS, ETC.) WHICH WAS DESCRIBED TO [[KUMIN || 17]] DURING [[HER ||17]] VISIT TO [[WASHING- TON ||16 ]].
