TO [[THE SECRETARY ||1]] FROM [[ROGERS || 2]]


SUMMARY: THE STATE OF SIEGE IN [[COLOMBIA || 3]] IS A RELUCTANT RESPONSE BY [[PRESIDENT LOPEZ  || 4]] TO WIDESPREAD DISORDERS. DISILLUSIONMENT OVER [[LOPEZ' || 4]] INABILITY TO FIND QUICK SOLUTIONS TO [[COLOMBIA'S || 3]] ECONOMIC PROBLEMS UNDERLIES THE UNREST IN [[COLOMBIA || 3]], BUT [[LOPEZ  || 4]] IS STILL FIRMLY IN CONTROL. THERE SHOULD BE NO APPRECIABLE EFFECT ON [[OUR || 5]] INTERESTS IN OR RELATIONS WITH [[COLOMBIA ||3 ]], AND [[LOPEZ' || 4]] STATE VISIT IN SEPTEMBER SHOULD NOT BE AFFECTED. END SUMMARY.


1. [[PRESIDENT ALFONSO LOPEZ || 4]] DECREED A [[NATIONWIDE ||3]] STATE OF SIEGE ON THE EVENING OF JUNE 26 FOLLOWING SEVERAL WEEKS OF PUBLIC DISORDERS IN A NUMBER OF CITIES, AND A MARKED INCREASE IN KIDNAPPINGS AND RURAL GUERRILLA VIOLENCE. [[LOPEZ' || 4]] ACTION CAME TWO WEEKS AFTER [[HE || 4]]  HAD IMPOSED A SIMILAR MEASURE IN THREE OF [[COLOMBIA'S  || 3]] LEADING DEPARTMENTS (STATES). THE MEASURE GIVES [[THE MILITARY  || 6]] INCREASED POWERS TO DEAL WITH PUBLIC ORDER PROBLEMS, AND UNDER IT CERTAIN CIVIL LIBERTIES CAN BE SUSPENDED IF DEEMED NECESSARY. [[LOPEZ' || 4]] ACTION IS PERMITTED UNDER ARTICLE 121 OF THE [[COLOMBIAN || 3]] CONSTITUTION. THE SITUATION IN [[COLOMBIA || 3]] WAS GENERALLY CALM ON JUNE 27.


2. [[LOPEZ  || 4]] ACTED RELUCTANTLY, SINCE [[HE || 4]]  HAD PROMISED AT [[HIS || 4]]  1974 INAUGURATION THAT [[HE || 4]]  WOULD ONLY IMPOSE A STATE OF SIEGE AS A "LAST RESORT". THE IMPOSITION OF THE STATE OF SIEGE DETRACTS FROM [[HIS || 4]]  LEFT-OF-CENTER IMAGE. THE DISORDERS WHICH LED TO [[HIS || 4]]  ACTION CAME ABOUT IN A CLIMATE OF GROWING DISILLUSIONMENT WITH [[LOPEZ || 4]]  FOR [[HIS || 4]] INABILITY RAPIDLY TO CORRECT [[COLOMBIA'S|| 3]] MANIFOLD ECONOMIC WOES, INCLUDING INFLATION, UNEMPLOYMENT, AND MALDIS- TRIBUTION OF INCOME. THE CURRENT WORLD RECESSION HAS BEEN AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN [[COLOMBIA'S|| 3]] SHORT-TERM PROB- LEMS. OVER THE LONG RUN THE ECONOMIC MEASURES [[HE  || 4]] IM- PLEMENTED LAST FALL SHOULD BE BENEFICIAL.


3. THE STATE OF SIEGE WILL INCREASE OPPOSITION TO [[LOPEZ  || 4]] FROM THE LEFT, BUT AT THE SAME TIME [[HE || 4]] WILL NOW HAVE THE TOOLS TO DEAL WITH DISORDERS. [[LOPEZ || 4]]  REMAINS IN FIRM CONTROL, AND HAS PROBABLY IMPROVED [[HIS || 4]]  STANDING WITH [[THE MILITARY ||6]] AND BUSINESS LEADERS.


4. IT DOES NOT APPEAR THAT THE STATE OF SIEGE WILL APPRECIABLY AFFECT [[OUR || 5]] INTERESTS IN [[COLOMBIA|| 3]] OR THE SEPTEMBER STATE VISIT OF [[LOPEZ || 4]]. [[AMERICANS || 7]] HAVE NOT BEEN TARGETS OF THE RECENT DISORDERS, EXCEPT FOR A SMALL DEMONSTRATION AT [[THE EMBASSY || 8]]. DURING THE PAST 30 YEARS STATES OF SIEGE HAVE BEEN IN EFFECT MORE OFTEN THAN NOT IN [[COLOMBIA|| 3]]. [[LOPEZ' || 4]]  PREDECESSOR, [[MISAEL PASTRANA || 9]], HAD A STATE OF SIEGE IN EFFECT FOR THREE OF [[HIS ||9]] FOUR YEARS IN OFFICE. SO IN THE [[COLOMBIAN || 3]] CONTEXT THE SITUATION IS NOT ABNORMAL.
