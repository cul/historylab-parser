RECENT CONTACTS BETWEEN [[DAYAN || 1]] AND [[PALESTINIANS || 2]] WHO HAVE IDENTIFIED [[PLO || 3]] CONNECTIONS. 


3. [[ ABU ODEH || 4]] SAID THAT [[GOJ || 6]] IS INCLINED TO BELIEVE THAT [[DAYAN'S || 1]] ACTIVITIES IN CONTACTING [[PALESTINIANS || 2]] ARE RELATED PRIMARILY TO INTERNAL [[ISRAELI || 8]] POLITICAL MANEUVERING. ATTRIBUTING THEORY TO [[JORDANIAN  || 5]] SOURCES IN THE [[WEST BANK || 19]], [[ ABU ODEH || 4]] OPINED THAT [[BEGIN'S || 9]] FAILING HEALTH HAS STIMULATED ACTIVITY ON THE PART OF A NUMBER OF WOULD-BE SUCCESSORS TO JOCKEY FOR POLITICAL POSITION. [[HE || 4]] INCLUDES [[DAYAN || 1]] IN THIS CATEGORY.


4. SPECIFICALLY IN REGARD TO  [[DAYAN'S || 1]] CONVERSATION WITH [[NATSHE || 10]], [[ ABU ODEH || 4]] POINTEDLY NOTED [[NATSHE'S || 10]] COMMUNIST AFFILIATION. IN LIGHT OF FACT THAT [[GOI || 8]] PERMITTED [[NATSHE || 10]] TO RETURN TO [[WEST BANK || 19]] , [[ ABU ODEH || 4]] SUSPECTS THAT [[GOI || 8]]  MAY BELIEVE THAT THE COMMUNISTS SOMEHOW MIGHT BE POLITICALLY MORE MALLEABLE THAN ARE THE "NATIONALISTS." [[ ABU ODEH || 4]] NOTED THE AFFINITY BETWEEN [[ISRAELI ARABS || 11]] AND [[THE RAKAH || 13]] ; PERHAPS SOME [[ISRAELI || 8]] LEADERS THINK THAT THEY CAN CREATE A COUNTERPART POLITICAL FORCE IN [[THE WEST BANK || 19]] CENTERED ON PERSONS SUCH AS [[NATSHE || 10]].


5. CHARGE NOTED THAT CRITICISM HAS BEEN LEVELED AGAINST [[HIKMAT AL-MASRI || 14]] FOR HAVING MET WITH [[AMBASSADOR STRAUSS || 15]]([[JERUSALEM || 7]] 2890). AGAIN, [[ ABU ODEH || 4]] SAW THE HAND OF THE COMMUNISTS BEHIND SUCH CRITICISM. [[HE || 4]] ALLUDED TO THE BITTER RIVALRY WHICH EXISTS BETWEEN [[AL-MASRI || 14]] AND [[[[NABLUS || 7]] MAYOR SHAKA  || 16]] (WHO IS [[[[MASRI'S || 14]] BROTHER-IN-LAW) || 16]] . [[ ABU ODEH || 4]] PORTRAYS [[SHAKA || 16]] AS A POORLY EDUCATED, WEAK LEADER WHO DEPENDS HEAVILY ON THE COUNSEL OF AN (UNNAMED) COMMUNIST ADVISOR.  [[HE || 4]] ECHOED OPINION EXPRESSED BY [[YUSIF RIDA || 17]] THAT OPPOSITION TO [[AL-MASRI || 14]] WILL NOT AMOUNT TO MUCH.
