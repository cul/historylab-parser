1. [[EMBOFF||1]] DISCUSSED [[WARSAW||2]] CONFERENCE WITH [[W. M. JARVIS, VISITS COORDINATOR OF [[EXTAFF [[EAST EUROPEAN||5]] DIVISION||4]]||3]]. DESPITE NOTICE OF DISCUSSION TOPIC, [[JARVIS||3]] APPEARED TO KNOW LITTLE ABOUT CONFERENCE AND SAID THAT NO INFORMATION HAD COME FROM [[[[CANADIAN||7]] EMBASSY IN [[WARSAW||2]]||6]].

2. AFTER HEARING RATIONALE FOR [[U.S.||8]] PARTICIPATION, [[HE||3]] EXPRESSED CONSIDERABLE INTEREST IN IDEA OF MORE ACTIVE [[WESTERN||16]] ROLE AT [[[[EAST||17]]-[[WEST||16]] YOUTH||15]] CONFERENCE IN VIEW OF [[HELSINKI||9]] BASKET III OBJECTIVES. [[HE||3]] ADDED, HOWEVER, THAT PAST [[CANADIAN||7]] PRACTICE OF NON-PARTICIPATION COULD PROBABLY NOT BE CHANGED IN TIME FOR JUNE MEETING. [[HE||3]] CITED BUDGETARY RESTRICTIONS AS WELL AS [[CANADIAN||7]] DESIRE FOR WIDER [[WESTERN||16]] COORDINATION. [[HE||3]] SAID [[CANADA||7]] WOULD CONSIDER ISSUE IMPORTANT ENOUGH TO DISCUSS IN [[NATO||10]] FORUM, NOT IN RELATION TO [[WARSAW||2]] MEETING BUT FOR OTHERS IN FUTURE, SO AS TO COORDINATE [[CSCE||11]] EFFORT AT YOUTH CONFERENCES MULTILATERALLY. [[HE||3]] SAID [[HE||3]] WOULD BRIEF [[[[CANADIAN||7]] EMBASSY IN [[WASHINGTON||13]]||12]] ON DISCUSSION FOR POSSIBLE FURTHER TALKS.

3. COMMENT: RECENT BUDGET CUTS AND SHORT NOTICE FOR JUNE MEETING ARE LEGITIMATE PROBLEMS WHICH MAKE [[CANADIAN||7]] PARTICIPATION AT [[WARSAW||2]] UNLIKELY. [[EMBOFF||1]] ALSO SENSED, HOWEVER, THAT [[CANADA||7]] RELUCTANT TO SEEK INVITATION IN ABRUPT MANNER WHICH MIGHT SUGGEST UNILATERAL IMITATION OF [[US||8]], ESPECIALLY IN POSSIBLY RISKY VENTURE. HENCE EMPHASIS ON MULTILATERAL APPROACH, WITH SEEMINGLY GENUINE INTEREST TO DISCUSS GENERAL ISSUE OF PARTICIPATION AT YOUTH CONFERENCE FURTHER.
